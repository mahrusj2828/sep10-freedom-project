Day One: Add the text for the title, context, and different past hardwares and softwares. Add the cards for the different examples of hardwares and softwares. Then add the text for two future device inventions.

Day Two: Add the different bootstrap elements for the different parts of text. The element `animate_pulse` should go with the title to make it pulse, the element `animate_backInLeft` should go with the context/history of marine bio and how different hardwares and softwares are being developed to make them come from the left, the element `animate_backInUp` should go with the cards to make them come from the top, and `animate_backInRight` should go with the future device inventions to make them come from the right.
