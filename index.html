                        <h1 class="fontsizing">Marine biology is the study of marine life and organisms of the ocean. The exploration of marine biology began in the early to late 1700s with Captain James Cook from Britain. But it has spanned to even longer periods of time from 384-322 BC when Aristotle tracked and recorded multiple species of marine life. Marine biology studies the changes of the ecosystem that could be impacted by people or other natural factors. Since it is said that life came from the oceans and most of Earthâ€™s living organisms exist in our seas, people strive to study more about what happens underneath the surface.</h1>

                        <h1 class="fontsizing">From 1728 to present day 2022, there has been a lot of new data recorded on our oceans and seas through the use of several devices and tools to collect data and information. I will go over the different types of devices and tools that are used in marine biology on this site that can be put into two groups, software and hardware, that have been made in the past and also innovations that could be created in the future. Throughout the years, people have created several softwares that take part in the study of the ocean that are not entirely direct such as the Oceanographic Decision Support System, MB-System Seafloor Mapping Software, Sharks & Rays, and Deep Sea ID. People have also created many different types of hardware which is more physically challenging and more hands on. These include the hamon grab, floats and drifters, salinometers, hydrophones, sonars, and submarines.</h1>

This device can collect samples from freshwater and saltwater sources (ponds, lakes, oceans, rivers etc.) This device measures the amount of oxygen produced by the phytoplankton and stores the oxygen in a separate container. Along with measuring the amount of oxygen produced, it also measures how much sunlight is being absorbed. This device not only measures the amount of oxygen produced by phytoplankton, but it also measures the amount of oxygen produced by plants on land and compares how much more the plants or phytoplankton make.</h1>

This device also takes part in researching on how the animals live and how they interact with their environment so that it can give more information and recommendations on what can be done to help the environment. Information stored on this device can be transferred to other electronic devices (computers, laptops, phones etc.)</h1>
