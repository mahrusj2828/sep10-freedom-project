                        The exploration of marine biology began in the early to late 1700s with Captain James Cook from Britain. But it has spanned to even longer periods of time from 384-322 BC when Aristotle tracked and recorded multiple species of marine life. Marine biology studies the changes of the ecosystem that could be impacted by people or other natural factors. Since it is said that life came from the oceans and most of Earthâ€™s living organisms exist in our seas, people strive to study more about what happens underneath the surface.

I will go over the different types of devices and tools that are used in marine biology on this site that can be put into two groups, software and hardware, that have been made in the past and also innovations that could be created in the future. Throughout the years, people have created several softwares that take part in the study of the ocean that are not entirely direct such as the Oceanographic Decision Support System, MB-System Seafloor Mapping Software, Sharks & Rays, and Deep Sea ID. People have also created many different types of hardware which is more physically challenging and more hands on. These include the hamon grab, floats and drifters, salinometers, hydrophones, sonars, and submarines.
